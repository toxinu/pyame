======Install Grub2 on Archlinux======

If you want to upgrade your grub-legacy to grub2 do that.



On your archlinux system : 

<code>

pacman -S grub2

grub-install /dev/sdX --no-floppy

</code>

Where sdX is your boot partition.

<code>

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

</code>

And reboot !



If you want to add another entrie, write it in ///etc/grub.d/40_custom//.



An example for a windows entrie :

<code>

# (2) Windows XP

menuentry "Windows XP" {

set root=(hd0,3)

chainloader +1

}

</code>

Save and enter : 

<code>

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

</code>

It's done !
