## Install Grub2 on Archlinux

If you want to upgrade your grub-legacy to __grub2__ do that.

On your archlinux system : 

    pacman -S grub2
    grub-install /dev/sdX --no-floppy

Where _sdX_ is your boot partition.

    grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

And reboot !

If you want to add another entrie, write it in __/etc/grub.d/40_custom/__.

An example for a windows entrie :

    # (2) Windows XP
    menuentry "Windows XP" {
    set root=(hd0,3)
    chainloader +1
    }

Save and enter : 

    grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

It's done !
